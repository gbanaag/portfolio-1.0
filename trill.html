          <h2 class="emphasis"> Users wanted community! </h2>
          <p style="font-size: 1.2vw;">
            In December 2020, at the start of the project, RISE did not have an established visual brand, which made it 
            hard for individuals interested in the program to keep up with RISE branded content. Additionally, at the time,
            RISE was a new program and wasn't well-known among its target audience.
            <br><br>
            I was onboarded to the project through JUV Consulting and tasked with designing a visual identity, as well as social media posts in line with the identity that I designed, that would be implemented into RISEâ€™s social media pages to establish a visual brand for the organization, and to attract more social media users to keep up with RISEâ€™s content.

          <h3 class="box-header" style="color: #7B59DC"> RESEARCH </h3>
          <h2 class="emphasis"> Aim for playful, Gen Z trending visuals. </h2>
          <p style="font-size: 1.2vw;">
            As soon as I was given the task, I knew I planned to incorporate popular design trends into the content I 
            created - working towards bold colors and placing an emphasis on including illustrations. 
            <br><br>
            Working for a Generation Z culture centric company, my projectâ€™s leadership and consultants placed an emphasis 
            on creating social media content that was both visually appealing to teenagers and was easily reshareable and 
            applicable to todayâ€™s youth. Some inspiration for posts that they highlighted were very visual heavy, 
            infographic-esque content. 
            <br><br>
            Overall, the project managers I worked with wanted a brand that was gen-z focused, playful in a sense, but 
            wasnâ€™t too childish.

            <p style="margin-top: 1.2vw; font-size: 1.2vw;">
              I was tasked with creating 3 sample posts that promoted our first campaign, which intended
              to introduce the program and generate hype. My initial approach was to create graphics that had the following properties:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li style="margin-top: .5vw;"> Bold, bright colors </li>
              <li style="margin-top: .5vw;"> Freeform illustrations </li>
              <li style="margin-top: .5vw;"> Work based theme </li>
              <li style="margin-top: .5vw;"> Doodles and scribbles </li>
            </ul>

          <h2 class="emphasis"> Higher social media engagement! </h2>
          <p style="font-size: 1.2vw;">
            RISE has received higher engagement on posts. Likes had increased by 300% within the first 3 weeks of releasing new content!
            Their Instagram page has grown from 1,100 followers to 5,500 as of June 2021. I am currently still a designer on the project. 
          </p>

          <h2 class="emphasis"> Shawn Mendes??? </h2>
          <p style="font-size: 1.2vw;">
            Probably one of my biggest flexes as a graphic designer is that my work with RISE has been promoted 
            in collaboration with the Shawn Mendes foundation, and I got to make a post for them. You can check 
            out the post here!

            To our other graphic designer on the team, Grace Lin - it's been a joy to navigate Figma with you and see how our work
            has blended together while working on the project.
