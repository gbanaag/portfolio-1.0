      <h1 class="titles"> My role </h1>
      <p class="grayed"> Front-end, Back-end, UX/UI Design </p>
      <p> I created the front-end, design, and illustrations for this project. Additionally, I worked on
        Firebase authentication to allow users to log in to the site, and provided a way for users to access
        data that they have submitted to the database. I also created a map to search for hospitals nearby.

      </p>

      <h1 class="titles"> Timeframe </h1>
      <p class="grayed"> 36 Hours </p>

      <h1 class="titles"> The Problem </h1>
      <p> The covid-19 pandemic has caused massive overcrowding in hospitals, with a lot of hospitals
        reaching full capacity. There is also a high risk of coming into contact with the virus in physical
        waiting rooms and medical spaces.
      </p>

      <h1 class="titles"> The Approach </h1>
      <p> I had the idea of making a platform that provided a way for patients to safely avoid overcrowding
        in hospitals and get access to resources based on need and severity (if they were at high risk of
        having covid or severe illnesses).

      <p class="grayed">  Graphics I made  </p>
      <h1 class="titles"> The design process </h1>
      <p> I designed a couple of mockups for the project prior to development. Since the project was sillier
        than other projects I worked on, I wanted it to have a playful and youthful feel, hence the scribbles
        as part of the design. Despite this, I wanted the project to still look polished to some extent, so I
        worked a sans serif font into the design. We picked purple to use for the overall style of the project
        because we associated the color with sleeping.
      </p>

      <h1 class="titles"> The building process </h1>
      <p> We thought it would be easiest to collaborate on a Glitch project since we were working remotely.
        We settled on using Firebase, because we didn‚Äôt have experience setting up a database or account
        authentication and believed using an external service would be the best option for the project.
        We also thought that using APIs would be useful to implement data external to the project into the
        website.

      </p>


      <h1 class="titles"> How it works </h1>
      <p> Users can submit a form on our website, answering what type of symptoms they have, which are
        then triaged by the EndlessMedicalAPI. This information is then sent to a database that can easily
        be accessed by hospitals.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p class="grayed"> The form </p>

      <p>  To update and access any information they have submitted, users are able to log
      in securely through Google Authentication. </p>

      <p class="grayed"> Google authentication </p>

      <p> Users can also look for hospitals near them through the Google Maps API. </p>

      <h1 class="titles"> What I learned </h1>
      <p> It was my first time working with both Firebase authentication and the Firebase Realtime Database,
        so I learned about how to log in users into a website and how to send data to a database. It was also
        my first time working with the Google Maps JavaScript API as well as the Places API, so I learned more
        about how to use both.
