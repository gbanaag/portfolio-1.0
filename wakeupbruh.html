    <p class="question"> üò¥ "What if there was a program that could detect when we were falling asleep and keep us in check?"</p>
    <img src="wakeupbruh/homepage.png" class="cover-img">

    <h1 class="titles"> My role </h1>
    <p class="grayed"> Front-end, Designer </p>
    <p> I worked on the front-end through React (it was my first time working with it at a hackathon!),
      and the some functions that triggered sounds and alerts that appeared on the screen.
    </p>

    <h1 class="titles"> Timeframe </h1>
    <p class="grayed"> 36 hours </p>

    <h1 class="titles"> The Problem </h1>
    <p> <a style="color: #6169D7; font-size: 1.2vw;" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidguo5499/" target="_blank"> My project partner </a> and I started falling asleep on our desks when listening to lectures remotely.
      We realized a lot of our friends had this problem too, and wanted to build a solution as a project. </p>

    <h1 class="titles"> The Approach </h1>
    <p> We created a website that detects when you're feeling tired and notify you, telling you to "wake up,
      bruh!" Whether you‚Äôre falling asleep at a really boring meeting, or you‚Äôre trying to drive late at night,
      WakeUpBruh works to keep you awake when you need it most.  </p>

    </div>
    <p class="grayed"> Mockups I designed for the project! </p>
    <h1 class="titles"> Wireframes and mockups </h1>
    <p> I designed a couple of mockups for the project prior to development. Since the project was sillier
      than other projects I worked on, I wanted it to have a playful and youthful feel, hence the scribbles
      as part of the design. Despite this, I wanted the project to still look polished to some extent, so I
      worked a sans serif font into the design. We picked purple to use for the overall style of the project
      because we associated the color with sleeping.
    </p>

    <h1 class="titles"> The building process </h1>
    <p> We settled on using React as a front-end framework. We believed that building a project with react
      would work best with the back-end of the project, and also wanted to try using a framework that we
      weren‚Äôt too familiar with. We picked up Tensorflow.js because of its face recognition library, and
      because we believed it would be easier to use than an API.

    <p class="grayed"> Detecting how open eyes were </p>

    <h1 class="titles"> How it works </h1>
    <p> In order to create a sleepiness detecting web app, we implemented facemesh.js in order to retrieve
      face landmarks, or key points that each map onto your facial features. Using these landmarks, we
      calculated the Euclidean distance between multiple coordinates in the upper and lower eyelids and
      averaged the results between two eyes. This gave us a number that would indicate how open someone‚Äôs
      eyes are. <br> <br> From this, we set a threshold on how open one‚Äôs eyes would need to be in order to be
      determined as sleepy, and made a set amount of time before the program would tell them to wake up.
      This set amount of time was used in order to account for blinking. Meeting the time condition would
      indicate that the user is tired, and the user would be warned to wake up through alerts.
    </p>

    <h1 class="titles"> What I learned </h1>
    <p> I became comfortable with using React and deploying projects through working on WakeUpBruh.
      I also learned more about the functions of Git by working on this project.
